# Directory Indexer

This project is a simple directory indexer built with PHP and HTML for websites. It allows you to list and browse files in a specified directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the directory indexer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your web host's main directory:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your web host's main directory.

2. Place the files you want to index in the `files` directory.

## Configuration

If you need to change the base directory, you should modify the `index.php` file:

1. Open the `index.php` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the line where the base directory is defined.
3. Change the base directory to your desired path.

```php
$base_directory = 'path/to/your/directory';
```

## Usage

Once deployed and configured, navigate to your web host in a web browser. The directory indexer will display the contents of the specified directory, allowing you to browse and access the files.
